This project performs sentiment analysis on e-commerce review data using Apache Spark (PySpark). The goal is to classify customer sentiments (positive, negative, neutral) based on review ratings and textual features. By leveraging PySpark's distributed computing, the system efficiently processes large-scale review data.
File Used: data5.csv
Description: Contains customer reviews along with ratings.

Preprocessing:
Data cleaning with Spark SQL functions
Text normalization (lowercasing, removing special characters)
Handling missing/null values
Indexing categorical variables using StringIndexer
Addressing class imbalance with oversampling

Technologies & Libraries
Apache Spark (PySpark)
SparkSession for data processing
StringIndexer for categorical encoding
LogisticRegression for classification
MulticlassClassificationEvaluator for evaluation
Python Libraries
matplotlib â†’ data visualization

Methodology
